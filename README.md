#### FilmQueryProject

### Description
The goal for this project was to create an application that allowed a user to search for a film from a database. The user could search for a movie based on it's ID or by searching a keyword, that would search the data base for a keyword match from the title or description of the movie. If a match was found, the user was presented a movie title, release year, rating, and description. If the user searched by keyword, and that keyword found multiple matches, then the user was presented a list with every match. Otherwise, if the search returned no results, the user was notified and prompted to try another search.

### Lessons Learned
This project was a fun introduction into databases and utilizing JDBC to retrieve data in various ways. This was also the first project in awhile where I didn't feel like I was completely lost the whole time. After taking several mock OCA exams, stepping away from java for a little bit, and then coming back to work on a project like this really solidified a lot of my understanding of the java language. Working with databases is hopefully something we continue to grow on, and learn how to create our own one day because this is something I have enjoyed learning over the past 4 days.
